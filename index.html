                    <p><em>Aesthetics (/ɛsˈθɛtɪks, iːs-/)</em> is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature of art,
                        beauty, and taste, with the creation and appreciation of beauty.

                        In its more technical epistemological perspective, it is defined as the study of subjective
                        and sensori-emotional values, sometimes called judgments of sentiment and taste. Aesthetics
                        studies how artists imagine, create and perform works of art; how people use, enjoy, and 
                        criticize art; and what happens in their minds when they look at paintings, listen to music,
                        or read poetry, and understand what they see and hear. It also studies how they feel about 
                        art-why they like some works and not others, and how art can affect their moods, beliefs, 
                        and attitude toward life. More broadly, scholars in the field define aesthetics as "critical
                        reflection on art, culture and nature". In modern English, the term aesthetic can also
                        refer to a set of principles underlying the works of a particular art movement or theory: 
                        one speaks, for example, of the Cubist aesthetic. </p>
