                <p>One time in 6th grade we were at recess and while I was running to my friends,
                I just so happened to kick a HUGE rock (keep in mind, I was wearing flip-flops so it hurt like hell)
                and without&nbsp;thinking, I shouted at the top of my lungs "MOTHERFUCKER!" And with my god-awful luck,
                my math teacher was sitting at the bench right BESIDE ME. He then took me <br> inside to what I thought 
                was yell at me but he just couldn't stop laughing and sent me back outside.
                <br>
                <br>
                He is still my favorite teacher I've ever had.</p>
